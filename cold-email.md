"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I hope I caught you at a good time?

I'm calling because I help local [Business Type] businesses like yours automate their lead follow-up and booking processes. 

Quick question: when someone calls your business and no one answers, what happens to that lead?"

[Listen to response]

"That's exactly what I thought. Most businesses lose 40-60% of their leads because of slow follow-up. I help fix that problem."
```

**Value Proposition:**
```
"What I do is set up an automated system that texts potential customers back within seconds, even when you can't answer the phone. It also handles appointment scheduling and follow-ups.

One client went from losing half their leads to capturing 90% of them.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute demo to see how this could work for your business?"

Quick question: what percentage of your customers make a second purchase?"

[Listen to response]

"That's pretty typical. Most e-commerce businesses see 20-30% repeat purchase rates, but I help my clients get that up to 45-60% using automated email sequences and customer retention systems."
```

**Value Proposition:**
```
"For example, I just helped an online retailer increase their repeat purchase rate from 23% to 51% in 4 months. Their average customer value went from $47 to $89.

Quick question: what's your current trial-to-paid conversion rate?"

[Listen to response]

"That's actually pretty good for the industry. Most SaaS companies see 10-15%, but I help my clients get that up to 25-35% through better onboarding and automated nurture sequences."
```

**Value Proposition:**
```
"I just helped a SaaS company similar to yours increase their conversion rate from 12% to 28% in 3 months. That extra 16% conversion rate added $180K in annual recurring revenue.

### Script 9.5: Real Estate Agents
**Opening:**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I'm calling because I help real estate agents like you convert more online leads into appointments and sales.

Quick question: when someone fills out a form on your website, how quickly do you typically respond?"

[Listen to response]

"That's better than most agents. The average response time is 2-3 hours, but studies show that leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert."
```

**Value Proposition:**
```
"What I do is set up an automated system that responds to leads within seconds with a personalized text message and gets them scheduled immediately.

One agent I work with went from converting 12% of her online leads to converting 34%. That's almost tripling her lead conversion rate.

Quick question: how much time do you spend each week on administrative tasks like scheduling, follow-ups, and client onboarding?"

[Listen to response]

"That's time you could be spending with clients or growing your business. I help coaches reclaim 5-10 hours per week through automation."
```

**Value Proposition:**
```
"For example, I just helped a business coach automate her entire client onboarding process. She went from spending 4 hours per new client to 30 minutes, and her clients actually reported better experiences.

Would you be open to a quick conversation about how we could free up similar time in your practice?"
